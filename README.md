### Installation & Usage
Should not require any additional tools in modern *nix systems, simply clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/avalonv/cursewordle`

then cd into the new directory and run:

`./cursewordle.py`

### Windows
The python curses module isn't available on Windows.

Alternatives such as Uni-Curses seem to be unreliable, so I don't plan to support it.

#### TODO:
Allow passing of arguments for what the word should be

Maybe add nyt option which syncs with the official game's word of the day

Possibly also add option to print emoji summary at the end like the official game

Maybe add hard mode (probably not)
